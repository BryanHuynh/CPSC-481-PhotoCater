## Executive summary:  

Sometimes when people are looking at photos, they might ask themselves where the photographer took the photo. This report describes the process our team followed to produce an informative way to find the answer to their question. Through a lack of detailed location information from major social media companies we identified that there was a hole in the market to try to give users a pinpoint location of where photographers are taking their photos. Through the use of surveys sketching and lo-fidelity prototyping we built a high-fidelity prototype of the application Photocator, that we feel represents the correct solution to the problem giving the user a dynamic and easy to use application aiming to help them find where to take their next photograph. By creating this easy-to-use application, we hope to eliminate the question: “where was that taken?” 

## Introduction 

Our project seeks to help people find the best places to take photographs using tools like GPS locations and map displays used in applications like google maps. By using these technologies and design elements to create a fluid way to utilize them we can connect users with the different experiences that they want to capture on film. 

 

## Description of your Design Problem 

As the pandemic has pushed more people outside to maintain social distancing, we have begun to explore our cities and surroundings with much more gusto than we have before. This drive for exploring, has created a desire to find cool places to explore. Since social media is quite prevalent today, it is important that we give users easy accessibility in order to find amazing spots to make their pictures look their best. Whether you are just looking for somewhere to relax or somewhere to take pictures, having a place for people to share the places that they have found with their communities can be an important way for people to interact with their now distanced acquaintances. 

## Description of your Design Solution 

By creating a website where we can all share our favorite spots and share the photos that we have taken, this would be a great way to get out of the house while keeping safe. The Website will include sharing and messaging features with users on the webapp, allowing people to connect with each other, and helping to maintain that sense of community through a digital medium. The application would also contain photos that others have taken and shared as well, and the ability for their followers to like and share that location. The photo that the user takes will give them the option to tag/share their current location.  It would also contain a feature in which you can link your social media profile, and it can tell you who on your friends list (of said social media app) has visited or have taken a picture at that specific location. This website is different than certain applications like Google Maps and Instagram. This website focuses on just beautiful views that one could go to or just take pictures and share it with others. This is more specifically different than Instagram because you can click on a location, find all the pictures and it would show you the exact conditions the photo was taken in like the time and weather. The difference between this and Google Maps is that these photos will be less of a review of the location but more of a review of the scenery for things like portraits. 

## End-user and Stakeholders 

The following is a list of pertinent stakeholders and end-users: 

### Stakeholders: 

- Advertisers 

- Freelancers/Models - can be used as a portfolio builder 

- Architects/Artists - they care about how their work will be represented 

- Park conservationists – data can be gathered on which parks are being visited most. 

### Users: 

- Avid photographers 

- Individuals looking for high quality photography images for personal or commercial use 

## User Research Methods, Process, and Findings 

In order to better understand our design problem and solution, we conducted three user research methods by using IDEO cards as a reference: 

### Surveys and Questionnaires 

Justification: Creating a survey is incredibly helpful for gathering user research because we can directly ask our users information that can help us develop our application. 

Process: As a group, we developed a list of survey questions that we believe would help us better understand our product. We then provided this survey to other students of CPSC 481 to fill out. We compiled and discussed the results obtained from our system and determined the parts that could help us move forward in a design direction that complemented the users needs.

<!-- there are 2 pictures here  -->

Findings: We found that a hundred percent of applicants use social media, this means that implementing a social media linkage would be crucial for our app. A lot of our applicants also mainly like taking pictures at around national parks, this means that majority of our applicants like taking pictures outside in nature. We also have discovered that more than 80 percent of our applicants take different photos based on weather, this means that implementing a function that displays different photos taken during different weather conditions would be a valuable function.

### Personal Inventory 

Justification: By asking different users what they think are important items to them when taking photos helps us identify what personal values and items the user believes to be important when they are going to be engaging with the application. 

Process: We developed another survey. In this one we asked users what items they felt were important to them in different contexts. We asked what is important to users when they are deciding where they want to take photos. We also asked users what they take with them when they go out to take photos. We received many responses. 

<!-- there is a picture here  -->

Findings: We found from the answers that with the trend of the participants phone being one of the first things listed as important to them when taking photos, we found that all users should have their phones around so it would maybe make more sense to change the medium of the application to mobile over web. 

### Character Profiles 

Justification: Creating separate demographics of different people within different age groups can help us identify relations between the different groups and our application functions. 

Process: Based on observations of real people, we developed 3 different character profiles. Each profile was given a career, a description of what they did in their free time, and a description of how they would benefit from an application such as ours, among other information. 

Findings: Based off survey and its relation to the character profiles, we learned that all applicants within all demographics use social media. The Character Profiles can be found in Appendix A. 

## Important Design Choices and Justification (incomplete) 

Important design choices were explored and developed using the following methods: 

Sketching 

As a group, each member provided 5 independent sketch ideas about what might encompass our Photocator website application. Once the sketches were complete, as a group, we all discussed the implications of each design, extracted important ideas out of sketches. Some of our sketches are below.:

## Low-Fi Design, Lessons Learned 

In our low-fidelity prototype we prototyped the following things: 

### Vertically: 

- Uploading and sharing photos 

- Social Media Linkage 

- Finding Photos and landmarks 

### Horizontally: 

- Logging in to the website with a Photocator account 

- Adding friends (All social media platforms) 

- Leaving a review on a location or commenting on a photo 

- Read reviews or comments on a location 

- Users can edit and customize their own profile 

- An accessibility tab is there to accommodate Users with unique needs 

- Add a new location 

- Users can go to other user’s or friend’s social media or profile to see more photos by that user 

- Filtering pins based off different tags 

<!-- three pictures go here -->

Our low-fi design was depicted using wireframes developed through the Balsamiq Wireframes program. 

After the low-fi prototype was developed we utilized a cognitive walkthrough (Appendix C) in order to better learn about our system. We outlined a set of tasks that users would have to run through. We learned that some problems existed in our prototype. Some problems that we ran into were ambiguity of some steps that a user would have to take to perform certain tasks. An example of this was when a user would want to upload a photo, they would have to press the plus button to do so. The problem that we saw this that was that a user might not know what that button is or what it does. The solution we produced was that when the user hovers over the button it will say “upload photo”. In addition, we thought it would be worthwhile to automate some of the user's task to better the user’s experience, like how when a photo was going to be uploaded, we wanted the system to investigate the photos meta-data and look for key information about the photo.  

## H-Fi Design, Lessons Learned 

Using our wireframes from our low-fidelity design, we developed a high-fidelity prototype using the Figma prototyping software. We prototyped the following things: 

### Vertically: 

- Uploading and sharing photos 

- Social Media Linkage 

- Finding Photos and landmarks 

- Editing User Profile 

### Horizontally: 

- Logging in to the website with a Photocator account 

- Adding friends (All social media platforms) 

- Leaving a review on a location or commenting on a photo 

- Read reviews or comments on a location 

- Users can edit and customize their own profile 

- An accessibility tab is there to accommodate Users with unique needs 

- Add a new location 

- Users can go to other user’s or friend’s social media or profile to see more photos by that user 

- Filtering pins based off different tags 

<!-- four pictures here -->

What we learned from our prototype was that the design process thus far was very useful in guiding is in which direction we should develop our prototype. This included the tasks that should be prototyped, as well as a rough outline of what that would look like. We learned to inculcate many UX principles, such as how contrast ratios make the application more user-friendly, or how text size is important for usability. From our high-fidelity prototype we gained a better understanding of where some problems existed In our application, with respect to design choices. 

## Heuristic Evaluation and Findings 

You can see our heuristic evaluations documents in the appendix, this includes the evaluation tables and the ranked problems that our reviewers found. To explain the process of our heuristic evaluation, we simply split the team into two parts reviewers (40%) and evaluators (60%).  

For the evaluators, we basically looked at each heuristic test individually and ran a series of user tasks to test if we violated these rules or not, we also made sure to keep specific examples to further prove that a test was violated or applied. After that the evaluators came together and compared their tables seeing for any similarities, this allowed us to create a refined final evaluation table for the reviewers.  

For the reviewers, they simply looked at each problem and ranked them on a scale of severity (which is in the appendix) and gave a brief description on their reasoning. 

We found many problems in the heuristic evaluation, which were: 

- Ambiguous Icons 

- Error Messages 

- No undo button on comments 

- Ambiguity between the back button and the close button 

There are descriptions provided for each problem in the appendix. We found that heuristic evaluation is very important because it outlined many problems that we never encountered or thought of while prototyping. After the evaluation, we thought that we didn’t have any usability problems with our prototype, but the heuristic evaluation outlined these errors which allowed us to create a more refined version of our prototype 

## Design Changes Made Based on the Stage 4 Heuristic Evaluation 

The changes we made based of our problems found from our heuristic evaluation were: 

### Adding an undo button on comments 

- Before: 

<!-- there is a picture here -->

- After:

<!-- there is a picture here  -->

If a user made a mistake on commenting on a post that they did not which to comment on, they never had the choice to undo or delete their comment restricting their freedom. 

### Making icons less ambiguous 

- Before: 

<!-- there is a picture here  -->

- After:

<!-- there is a picture here  -->

The upload photo icon was just a ‘+’ symbol, this could be very confusing and ambiguous to some users so we changed it to an icon that was less ambiguous. 

### Put the back button and close button in places where it’s appropriate and less ambiguous 

- Before: 

<!-- there is a picture here  -->

- After:

<!-- there is a picture here  -->

As you can see there is a close button and a back button on the same page, but they both closed the overlay, so there was no need for the back button. 

### Added error messages to prevent user errors: 

- Before: 

<!-- there is a picture here  -->

- After:

<!-- there is a picture here  -->

We needed to added error messages wherever errors could occur. In this example, in order to upload a photo, the user needs to choose an image before clicking the submit button. We did not have this before, which could’ve created many errors for the user, which is why we implemented error messages for these problems. 

## Changes Made on Final Hi-Fi in your Stage 5 

The changes we made in our hi-fidelity prototype included making a fully functioning friend tab, allowing to add friends on the photocator platform as well as linking your social media through the friend tab. 

The other changes we made were, creating an accessibility tab for the map, we have implemented different ways for the viewer to view the map, depending on their desires.  

### The different styles for the maps are: 

- Satellite view 

- Dark Mode 

- Light Mode 

We also added a function to delete pictures that were posted by a user from their profile and the map. Furthermore, we created a confirmation message for the user that pops up when they press the log out button, to ensure they want to log out.  

Another change that we made was creating a filter for filtering out specific themes of photos you would want to view and visit. 

### Changes that should be done: 

Some changes that should be made in the future would be making sure that all styles of maps are fully functional, because as of right now the map styles are just a preview of what it would look like.  

We should also ensure that the social media linkage works and when they are clicked on, on the user's profile, that it takes them to that social media. 

We should also ensure that the messaging feature is fully functional and allows users to interact. 

### Changes that could be done: 

Some changes that could be done in the future would be integrating different color schemes for a more professional visual design of our application.  

Another change would be integrating more choices in our accessibility tab, the only choices so far are changing the styles of the map, and so far, they are only previews. We can add additional features to the accessibility tab, like font changes for example changing text to comic sans for people with dyslexia, color schemes, etc. 

## Conclusions of Your Choice 

By following the principles of design covered in this course, we believe we developed a high-fidelity prototype that fits the needs of the users and stakeholders that it attempts to target. Photocator is a project that was developed by considering many different avenues, using useful feedback of some sort at every step of the design process. Rather than leaving it to a small group to define the problems that our application could solve, we left it to our user research methods to better understand our problem. We used the feedback from this research to determine the most pertinent user tasks to further explore. As a team, we explored 20 different sketched ideas which we categorized, discussed, narrowed down, and refined. Rather than choosing the first idea that came to mind, this process truly led us to explore many different design directions before collectively agreeing on one. By using all this information, we developed a low-fi prototype that we felt mirrored our expectations well. However, staying true to the design process we continued to research this low-fi prototype by running it against various user-tasks. This information, collectively with all previous information gathered, led us to develop a high-quality hi-fi prototype as the final deliverable of this product. As we followed the design process methods learned and outline throughout this course, we are confident that we developed a deliverable that we can proudly say accomplishes the goal that it set out to.

### Appendix D: Heuristic Evaluation Documents:


#### Evaluator: Ryan 

| Rule of Thumb | Is this rule being applied? How so? | Is this rule violated? How so? | How can this rule further improve usability, utility and desirability? |
|---|---|---|---|
| Visibility of system status | Because our system is currently static here is no need for the application of progress bars. || We could apply a progress bar to photos when they are loading in for the user as they are trying to upload a photo, so they know that the photo is loading and not just empty. In addition to a progress bar for uploading photo so they know when they can exit out the page. |
| Match between system and the real world | Yes, all icons that were used match the icons that match the real world. For example, when viewing the descriptions of the photos each category is associated with their exact icon that matches the real world. | Yes, in the nav bar some of the icons are ambiguous to show what that button does. For example, the upload photo button is a plus sign. These icons do not match the real world. | Using these rules, this will help increase usability because it will be easier for users to identify what these buttons do, and it will increase desirability because if these buttons are easily distinguishable it will make user workflow more effortless. |
| User control and freedom | Yes, in our pages, we support a ‘back’ button for users to go to a previous page just in case they went to a page they did not desire. | Yes, when you post a comment on someone’s picture, there is no option to undo that comment. | Using these rules this will help users prevent doing tasks that they did not mean to do. This will increase desirability because it will help users prevent doing undesirable tasks. |
| Consistency and standards | When starting this project, we made sure to standardize our buttons. In addition, these buttons would function in the same way on other pages. For example, All the uses of the back-button work in similar manners where they will close the overlay or return to the previous page. | In our system we have a back button that can either function to close the overlay or return to the previous screen. While this isn’t a major issue, it would be more clear for the user if we had separate button styles differing the two. | Through this we were able to easily help the user in achieving their task. From the start when the user clicks on a button and find another button of the same style, they can rest assured that the button will act in that situation the same way. |
| Error prevention | Yes this rule is being applied. When looking at the Photo upload and the edit profile forms, the user is prompted multiple times to make sure that the actions that they are taking are in fact what they intended. We also gray out buttons to prevent users from clicking on the button before a certain action. For example, when uploading a photo we gray out the confirm button until someone selects a photo. | Yes, when adding a comment we don’t check with the user before posting that they wanted to post what they wrote, so say the user accidentally presses the Enter key early they might post something they either didn’t mean to. | By maintaining error prevention we can help the user represent themselves the way they best want to by prompting them to make sure that they are entering the correct information. |
| Recognition rather than recall | Yes, this rule is being applied. We ensure that one would know where in the action they are by labelling everything and having arrows to point to the actions one would have to do, to ensure a task in completed. For example, if one wanted to upload a photo, that action has instructions all along the way like having a label that says “click here” when they need to put their location in the map. | No, we do not violate this example. | Through these steps and instructions that a user would have to take in order to complete a task it ensures that they do not miss any important steps and making it easier for the user to use our website application. | 
| Flexibility and efficiency of use | If a user knew of a location that they wanted to find photos at they could use that term in our search system to find a gallery of photos speeding up the user's ability to find photos that they want. | For our system currently, there is no way for a user to speed up whatever task they want. For example, if they wanted to find a specific photo, they will always need to find that pin on the map and find the photo in the gallery. | For further functionality we could have decided that we wanted to add a system allowing the user to find photos that they will see before to a separate gallery for quick navigation. |
| Aesthetic and minimalist design | Yes, we use the same design pallet across all our different screens and overlays. By using the common colours to represent buttons the user knows that they have options to interact with the display. | no. | By maintaining a consistent theme across the application User’s being to develop a sense of familiarity to help them navigate through the app and perform the actions that they are looking to do without needing more training or information about what some button on the page does. |
| Helps users recognize, diagnose and recover from errors | No, this rule is not being applied. | We do not contain any error messages for the user just in case they click on the wrong button. |By applying these rules this will help users fix their problems and it will prevent them from doing it again, this increases usability and desirability for the users because it helps users learn how to use the application properly. Also providing further assistance on a step that they missed so that they can go back and correct that error. |
| Help and documentation | Yes, when uploading a photo, we explicitly provide information on what to do to complete the task. When uploading we provide information on the pages for the user. For example, the first page is for uploading a photo and there is message that says it, and when choosing a location there is button that says “click here” to tell users what to do. | No, when signing up for the website our sign up requires putting in an email except we do not give an example or a template for it. We could’ve put a placeholder example into the text field. | This will help users complete these tasks will full information on how to complete them properly without any errors or undesirable outcomes.  |
 

#### Evaluator: Don 

| Rule of Thumb | Is this rule being applied? How so? | Is this rule violated? How so? | How can this rule further improve usability, utility and desirability? |
|---|---|---|---|
| Visibility of system status | No, we do not implement anything here due to the nature of the application, there is no loading screens or anything progressive that requires progress tracking | Yes, For the user after they log into the system there is no information as to what screen they are on or what they are supposed to do. | By giving more information to the user they might have a better idea as to what page they are on in the app. While to the developers it is more apparent what the home screen is we could give more information to the user so that they know what they are being presented with on the screen to at least let them know they are on the home page for example. |
| Match between system and the real world | Yes, by highlighting on the screen after they have added a new photo where they put that photo, they know that the new pin on the screen is one that they had added. |Yes, When the user goes to view on the pin the exact location of a photo there is no information telling them that this is a different screen so they might go looking on this chart for more pins to interact with when they are in a mode that is about reflecting where the photo exactly was taken. |By making sure that the user knows exactly where they are by giving them more information like a little window telling them which mode, they are in they might feel less lost and confused when looking around for more pins should they have changed modes from seeking pins. |
| User control and freedom | Yes, When the user is adding a new photo, they have the option to leave should they decide not to upload the photo without closing the application. | Yes, we have a few screens like viewing friends and the accessibility tab that we should have the ability to leave in multiple ways, but the user must click on the Close button to leave | By allowing the user to simply click to navigate away from a overlay it can help them feel less corned when navigating the page. |
| Consistency and standards | Yes, by using common colours to denote actionable buttons and areas where you can upload photos or add text the users know just from looking at the different buttons that something on the screen is a possible action that they can take. | Yes, by in some windows having the ability to click away from the overlay to close and in others not allowing that we are not being consistent about the different ways that the user can leave an action or go to a different screen. | By making it so that either all of the overlays have a “out of frame” exit the user will not become frustrated should they click on the outside of a overlay and they don’t exit. |
| Error prevention |---| Yes, when uploading a new photo if the user clicks on the next button when either selecting a photo and they have not made their choice the system does nothing. | It should maybe let the user know that there is no selection made and should address this before moving on. This will help the user avoid errors. |
| Recognition rather than recall | Yes, when looking at the photo’s page we use little icons to help the user recognize what each piece of information is conveying. | |This rule is used so that on each page the icons with the text can help them find the information that they are looking for faster without having to try and remember where to find certain pieces of information. They simply can look at the icons and know whats there. |
| Flexibility and efficiency of use |---|Yes, In our application we have no information about keyboard shortcuts to maybe speed things up for the more advanced user like pressing the ‘s’ key on the home screen to quickly access the search function.  | By adding these features to the app it might speed things up for the user novice and expert alike. Though it is worth mentioning that these are missing at the moment because of limitations with Figma and might be something of a note for the Team should this be fully implemented on the front and backend, not just a prototype. |
| Aesthetic and minimalist design | Yes, we keep things simple throughout the app with colourful and easy to read buttons for navigation and do not have anything on the display through any of the overlays that’s over stimulating for the user. | Yes, sometimes depending on the actions taken by the user there can be a lot of different overlays on the screen, while they are all simple in their own design over crowding can cause confusion. | By using a simple and clean design implemented consistently the confusion that the user might run into will be reduced. |
| Helps users recognize, diagnose and recover from errors |---| Yes, there is no error message for the user should they try to enter a photo without picking a location for where the photo was taken | By implementing a error message for the user when they fail to pick a location and they try to upload their photo, or even when they fail to do this for selecting a photo in the first place, we can cut down on the time wasted by the user when they are trying to advance in the upload process. |
| Help and documentation | Yes we don’t anywhere in the application have a help page should a user want more information about what a screen does | Should the buttons and the page fail to explain to the user what each page and overlay does through their implementation having a help button would be good to give an explanation to the user should they wonder about what some page does. |
 

#### Evaluator: Sarina 

| Rule of Thumb | Is this rule being applied? How so? | Is this rule violated? How so? | How can this rule further improve usability, utility and desirability? |
|---|---|---|---|
| Visibility of system status | In the current state of our prototype, and the limitations of Figma, we do not have a system to have the user wait for system responses.  | Because our prototype is currently static there isn’t anything dynamic happening, we do not have a need to implement any system to have the user wait as the system generates a response. | Because our system primarily is a server for photos that can by hundreds of Mb large, it would be beneficial, if not critical, that we have a system that indicates to the user to wait for the image to load. |
| Match between system and the real world | Yes, the system does real-world language and icons that one would see in any other app or website. We also use real-world language that any user would understand. Also using text when a user is hovering over an icon that might be unfamiliar.  | Yes, we have one icon that is a smiley face and that represent the accessibility tab, which is not a common icon that a user would see normally, so they would have to hover over the icon to see what it does. | This rule is very helpful as the user does not have to learn how to use the web application as every icon is easy to follow and familiar. |
| User control and freedom | | Yes, we should have the option to undo a comment if you accidentally posted the wrong comment. | Yes, this is important because the user should be able to have the freedom to leave a certain page without having to do undesirable tasks. |
| Consistency and standards | Yes, by using consistent colour schemes we can help the user better identify buttons and navigate the page easier.   | Yes, we violate in not all of our overlays have the ability to exit them from clicking elsewhere on the page.  | By making sure we follow our own design rules there will not be any cases where the user runs into a situation where they are stuck because they are trying to perform an action that works somewhere else but not on their current overlay.  |
| Error prevention | Yes, we ensure that the user is happy with the location and picture that they have chosen by giving them multiple chances to confirm they have the correct info.  | Yes, when you want to logout, it does not give you a warning before you do so. Just in case you accidentally press that logo.  | This is essential because there could be a human mistake somewhere along the way and it is important to make sure they can fix the mistake without any reprucutions.  |
| Recognition rather than recall | By using common colours we use the user’s previous knowledge of what items on the screen are buttons, so they are immediately attracted to the screens controls | No, we do not violate this example.  | This makes the application very desirable because it minimizes the user's memory load by giving clear instructions instead of them having to memorize each step along the way.  |
| Flexibility and efficiency of use | Yes, we have multiple ways of closing certain overlays  | Yes, there are ways that we could implement to speed up the process of the user experience like selecting a profile photo, they would always have to go through their gallery of photos to select a profile photo. | This is very desirable because it speeds up the process for the user.   |
| Aesthetic and minimalist design | Yes, we try and keep everything very minimalistic by trying to use icons in most places and only using one-word explanations for what each icon means when a user hovers over the icon. We also try and use different colors for different tasks like marking their location on the map when uploading a photo to indicate the new place they are marking.  | No, we do not violate this example.  | This helps the user understand what they are doing and makes everything most visually appealing and easy to follow.   |
| Helps users recognize, diagnose and recover from errors | No, we do not have any error messages that would prompt a user to go back and fix a mistake.  | Yes, currently we do not have any error messages built in in case a user tried to upload a photo without adding a location, the system would just not let them upload that photo and would not tell them what the issue is.  | This rule is very helpful to provide clarify for the user and direct them if they made a mistake somewhere along a task. |
| Help and documentation | Yes, we have prompts on the map when uploading a photo telling the user to click on the location they searched for.  | Yes, we do not have a help navigator or frequently asked questions section on the website.  | If we add more places for user’s to gather more information about how to use the website they might find the website more approachable. |

### Reviewer’s Findings (Bryan & Sajid)

We will use this table for severity ratings:

| Rating | Description |
|---|---|
| 0 | Doesn’t seem to be a usability problem |
| 1 | Cosmetic Problem |
| 2 | Minor usability problem |
| 3 | Major usability problem |
| 4 | Usability Catastrophe |
 

### Problem 1: Ambiguous icons 

#### Rating: 1 

- These icons due pose an issue since it makes it harder for the user to complete specific tasks since, these icons are ambiguous. However, this does not destroy any functionality on doing tasks in our prototype 

### Problem 2: Error messages 

#### Rating: 2 

- This problem is rated a 2 because although it is important to ensure the user completes all tasks required to uploading a photo, they will not be allowed to continue to the next step if a certain step is not done. Although it is important for the user to know exactly where they went wrong so that they can go back and fix the issue. 

### Problem 3: No undo on comments 

#### Rating: 3 

- This problem is rated a 3 because since there is no way for a user to undo a comment, they might not be able to remove something that they did not mean to post either because it was not complete, or it was not something that they meant to say. This also reduces the User’s ability to be free when using the app since they might be hesitant to post something since there either might be an unintentional error, or they cannot take something back that they did not mean. 

### Problem 4: Back button  

#### Rating: 2 

- The back button, functions as a back button and an exit button. However, this can cause some issues with users, because they may want to go back and not exit. This does not destroy functionality with the prototype but makes it more difficult for the users’ workflow.
