### Project Description: 

Our project idea is a photography landmark locator. This application is going to look like a navigation app like google maps, but instead the focus of this app is for people to share unique and interesting locations for beautiful photography. To do this, when a photo is uploaded, they will be asked to give a description of the longitude and latitude of the photo, along with the date and time of day, so that one can go out and recreate the photo if the wish. We also plan to link it towards social media, so you can see the pictures that your peers take.

### Top 3 Ideas

1. SOCIAL MEDIA LINKAGE 

- We want to use this app to increase exposure to all photographers despite their follow count.  

- By linking their social media, it will allow for people who find photos that they post to follow up and find even more photos on their social page.  

- When signing up, the users have a choice of linking their social media to their account, their choices for social media will be: 

    - Instagram 

    - Facebook 

    - Twitter 

- If they did not link their account when signing up, they will still have a choice in linking their account through the friend's tab on the main screen. 

- The user also has a choice of logging into their account with their choice of social media platform. 

2. FINDING NEW PHOTOS 

- We hope for people to find new photos and photographers of all follower counts.  

- The user can do many actions to find a photo of their choosing 

    - On the main screen there will be pins on the map, indicating pictures that we're taken from that place, when those pins are clicked a photo feed of pictures that were taken there will appear 

    - They can also filter these pins by categories 

        - Architectural 

        - Model 

        - Scenery 

        - Landscape 

        - Etc 

    - Choosing a filter will result in showing different pins based on the chose category. 

    - The search bar is used for searching specific places or coordinates to view pictures taken in that area. 

- The pin also contains much information of the pictures taken in that area: 

    - Reviews on the area 

    - If it's busy or not (COVID) 

    - When it was taken 

    - Etc 

- Also, the user will have a choice of seeing directions to get to that area, when the pin is clicked 

3. UPLOADING PICTURES 

- When the user has taken the photos that they want, and they upload them once they have copied them onto their computer or have them on their phone, they will have the option to upload the photos along with the location they were taken. When they click the upload button they will be taken to another screen where they will have to pick a pin or add a new one for where they took the photos. 

- If they are adding a new pin, they will be asked which form they would like to enter the location that could be one of the following choices: 

    - Google maps api search 

    - Lat long entry 

    - Pin drop on map  

- Once they enter the location of photoshoot, they can add comments or descriptions to like: 

    - Type of camera used  

    - How busy the location is  

    - Weather 

 ### Discussion of Groups

- Quality of Life/ Usability 

    - This grouping tangentially relates to the design requirement of logging in to the application, as well as interacting with uploaded assets. A weakness of this group is that it does not encompass any concise functionality. On the other hand, the generality it provides can be considered a strength as it allows for implementations that are universal to the web app. For example. By considering the accessibility idea, all UI components become more user-friendly to a more diverse range of people. The idea is feasible as it is simply taking existing functionality and making it easier to use. The grouping is also original, since ideas such as accessibility in a social media app, are rarely intricately implemented. 

- Finding Landmarks 

    - This grouping relates to the design requirements developed from the user-task descriptions of stage 2. Specifically, the tasks of viewing a map of the globe to be able to view landmarks on it, filtering available landmarks based on the user's preferences, and viewing more information about landmarks that the user is focusing on. A weakness of this grouping is that it does not take into consideration the social integration aspect of the web app, which is a major component of the app. A strength of this grouping is that it gives a good idea of how users will primarily interact with the app, which is through the use of a traversable map, in order to focus in on what the user is looking for. Furthermore, the grouping introduces the idea of filtering based on a user's needs, which is also a main functionality that succinctly provides users with the information they desire. As for feasibility, as finding landmarks is one of the most significant features of the web app, time can certainly be provided in developing this grouping. The idea of traversing a map to find locations isn’t original, however making it a main feature of a social media application certainly is. 

- Sharing Pictures 

    - This ties into the design requirements developed from the user-tasks of stage 2. Logging-in to an account creates the idea of a user within the web app ecosystem. By tying a user to an account, a user ends up with an identity on the web application. Viewing a photo feed is another user task related to this group, as is viewing a friends profile of pictures and uploading a users own assets to the website. A strength of this grouping is that it describes the social integration aspect of the web application. It considers the interactions that users will have with the system (web app) as well as the interactions that users will have with each other, in the form of uploading, sharing, and commenting on pictures that have been taken. A weakness of this grouping is that it does not consider the User Interface of the application. Ideas such as uploading pictures, credential-based log-in, and viewing profiles of friends, are all feasible ideas, and also major parts of the web app. A less feasible idea (time-permitting) would be the commenting on pictures idea. This grouping of sharing pictures is original when it is considered in relation to what is being shared, which in this case are pictures taken with extensive meta-data that includes items such as weather data, time of day, and latitude and longitude location data, among other things.
