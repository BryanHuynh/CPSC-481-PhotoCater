### The Problem

As the pandemic has pushed more people outside to maintain social distancing, we have begun to explore our cities and surroundings with much more gusto than we have before. This drive for exploring, has created a desire to find cool places to explore. Since social media is quite prevalent today, it is important that we give users easy accessibility in order to find amazing spots to make their pictures look their best. Whether you are just looking for somewhere to relax or somewhere to take pictures, having a place for people to share the places that they have found with their communities can be an important way for people to interact with their now distanced acquaintances.

### The Solution

By creating a website where we can all share our favorite spots and share the photos that we have taken, this would be a great way to get out of the house while keeping safe. The Website will include sharing and messaging features with users on the webapp, allowing people to connect with each other, and helping to maintain that sense of community through a digital medium. The application would also contain photos that others have taken and shared as well, and the ability for their followers to like and share that location. The photo that the user takes will give them the option to tag/share their current location.  It would also contain a feature in which you can link your social media profile, and it can tell you who on your friends list (of said social media app) has visited or have taken a picture at that specific location.
