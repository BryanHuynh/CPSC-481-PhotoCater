## PhotoCater

### Project Description: 

Our project idea is a photography landmark locator. This application is going to look like a navigation app like google maps, but instead the focus of this app is for people to share unique and interesting locations for beautiful photography. To do this, when a photo is uploaded, they will be asked to give a description of the longitude and latitude of the photo, along with the date and time of day, so that one can go out and recreate the photo if the wish. We also plan to link it towards social media, so you can see the pictures that your peers take.

### Top 3 Ideas

1. SOCIAL MEDIA LINKAGE 

- We want to use this app to increase exposure to all photographers despite their follow count.  

- By linking their social media, it will allow for people who find photos that they post to follow up and find even more photos on their social page.  

- When signing up, the users have a choice of linking their social media to their account, their choices for social media will be: 

- - Instagram 

- - Facebook 

- - Twitter 

- If they did not link their account when signing up, they will still have a choice in linking their account through the friend's tab on the main screen. 

- The user also has a choice of logging into their account with their choice of social media platform. 

2. FINDING NEW PHOTOS 

- We hope for people to find new photos and photographers of all follower counts.  

- The user can do many actions to find a photo of their choosing 

- - On the main screen there will be pins on the map, indicating pictures that we're taken from that place, when those pins are clicked a photo feed of pictures that were taken there will appear 

- - They can also filter these pins by categories 

- - - Architectural 

- - - Model 

- - - Scenery 

- - - Landscape 

- - - Etc 

- - Choosing a filter will result in showing different pins based on the chose category. 

- - The search bar is used for searching specific places or coordinates to view pictures taken in that area. 

- The pin also contains much information of the pictures taken in that area: 

- - Reviews on the area 

- - If it's busy or not (COVID) 

- - When it was taken 

- - Etc 

- Also, the user will have a choice of seeing directions to get to that area, when the pin is clicked 

3. UPLOADING PICTURES 

- When the user has taken the photos that they want, and they upload them once they have copied them onto their computer or have them on their phone, they will have the option to upload the photos along with the location they were taken. When they click the upload button they will be taken to another screen where they will have to pick a pin or add a new one for where they took the photos. 

- If they are adding a new pin, they will be asked which form they would like to enter the location that could be one of the following choices: 

- - Google maps api search 

- - Lat long entry 

- - Pin drop on map  

- Once they enter the location of photoshoot, they can add comments or descriptions to like: 

- - Type of camera used  

- - How busy the location is  

- - Weather
