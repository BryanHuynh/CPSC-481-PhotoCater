# PhotoCator

### Description: 

 

Our project idea is a photography landmark locator. This application is going to look like a navigation app like google maps, but instead the focus of this app is for people to share unique and interesting locations for beautiful photography. To do this, when a photo is uploaded, they will be asked to give a description of the longitude and latitude of the photo, along with the date and time of day, so that one can go out and recreate the photo if the wish. We also plan to link it towards social media, so you can see the pictures that your peers take.  

 

#### How do you expect the system to be used? 

We expect the user to use this whether they are an aspiring new photographer or a professional to find different interesting and exciting places to take photos. By sharing their pictures of the places that they have found themselves we expect them to help broaden and bring together the photography community.

#### By whom will the system be used? 

We expect that the users that will use our system, will be anybody who wants to take pictures. There is no limit for anyone to use this application.
